# To do - for simulating dipole satellite

#1 translational dynamics of orbit
#2 rotational dynamics of satellite
#3 extract time and lat/long from orbit - use as input to igrf model
#4 model experienced magnetic field on orbit - extract from igrf
#3 calculate torque due to dipole moment - feed back into rotational dynamics
#5 estimate dipole moment of actual flight magnets - update satellite properties to improve accuracy of model
